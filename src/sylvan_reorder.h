/**
 * sylvan_varswap implements parallelized in-place variable swapping.
 *
 * Swaps two consecutive variables in the entire forest.
 * We assume there are only BDD/MTBDD/MAP nodes in the forest.
 * The operation is not thread-safe, so make sure no other Sylvan operations are
 * done when performing variable swapping.
 *
 * Variable swapping consists of two phases. The first phase performs
 * variable swapping on all simple cases. The cases that require node
 * lookups are left marked. The second phase then fixes the marked nodes.
 *
 * It is recommended to clear the cache and perform clear-and-mark (the first part of garbage
 * collection, before resizing and rehashing) before running sylvan_varswap.
 *
 * If the parameter <recovery> is set, then phase 1 only rehashes nodes that have variable "var+1".
 * Phase 2 will not abort on the first error, but try to finish as many nodes as possible.
 *
 * Return values:
 *  0: success
 * -1: cannot rehash in phase 1, no marked nodes remaining
 * -2: cannot rehash in phase 1, and marked nodes remaining
 * -3: cannot rehash in phase 2, no marked nodes remaining
 * -4: cannot create node in phase 2 (ergo marked nodes remaining)
 * -5: cannot rehash and cannot create node in phase 2
 *
 * See the implementation of sylvan_simple_varswap for notes on recovery/rollback.
 *
 * Due to the nature of bounded probe sequences, it is possible that rehashing
 * fails, even when nothing is changed. Worst case: recovery impossible.
